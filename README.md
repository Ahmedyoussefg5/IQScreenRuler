As an iOS developer, I always feel the lack of simple app to **check position of objects/elements** in any picture or screenshot. Now it's very easy to find position and size of any UI element, **specifically {x,y,width,height)**.

This app is specially designed for making **Mobile Quality Assurance Engineer (QA Engg.)** life much easier. Now they can quickly review Mobile UI with **point & pixel perfect dimensions** within minutes.

###HOW IT WORKS:
**Step1:** Take Screenshot of the app to debug it. This will automatically be saved to your Camera Roll -> Screenshots album.

**Step2:** Open Screen Ruler app and you can see your recent screenshot, enable ruler and straight line frame.

**Step3:** Check your screenshot dimensions and UI element positions by zooming in/out and using rulers and line frame.
