As an iOS developer, I always feel the lack of simple app to check position of objects/elements in any picture or screenshot. Now it's very easy to find position and size of any UI element, specifically x/y position and width/height/size.

This app is specially designed for making Mobile Quality Assurance Engineer (QA Engg.) life much easier. Now they can quickly review Mobile UI with point & pixel perfect dimensions within minutes.
